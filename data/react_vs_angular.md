# Differences between React and Angular 4+

## Development Speed

React seems to be faster to develop, the setup is also simpler than Angular 4

## Enterprise apps and Server-side rendering

You usually don't worry about SEO etc., for enterprise webapps., and only about UX/performance.  So in that scenario, Angular is much better.  If you are developing something for personal use, showcase etc., react is better.  If you are providing a solution to an enterprise, Angular is the right choice.

## Performance

Both offer fast performance, however, Angular 2+ seems to have an edge.

## Mobile and Desktop

React provides re-usability of components for android and iOS devices.  If you are a startup or medium business (less than 5 years? organization), go with React to develop webapps quickly and provide a performance app to users.  If you have dedicated developer resources for each platform (android, ios, server) etc., go with native versions and for the web use Angular.
